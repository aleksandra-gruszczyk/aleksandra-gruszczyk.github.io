      <h2>This is a post answering a few prompts from DevAcademy about my core values. Here I say a bit about myself, what drives me, what holds me back. A bit expansive, I know!</h2>
      <p> <span style="font-weight: bold">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</span></p>
      <p>The company I worked for had a process of setting up auctions between clients and banks to ensure fair pricing of products. One time one of two auction participants withdrew, and this decision should have prompted the end of the auction process and the beginning of the negotiation process between the client and the one remaining bank. But my company representative decided to fake the auction for the benefit of the client and had one of my teammates pretend to be on the call with the other bank. The call ended and the whole situation was treated like something normal and not requiring an explanation by our leaders.  </p>
