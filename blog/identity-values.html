        <p>The company I worked for had a process of setting up auctions between clients and banks to ensure fair pricing of
          products. One time one of two auction participants withdrew, and this decision should have prompted the end of the
          auction process and the beginning of the negotiation process between the client and the one remaining bank. But my
          company representative decided to fake the auction for the benefit of the client and had one of my teammates
          pretend to
          be on the call with the other bank. The call ended and the whole situation was treated like something normal and
          not requiring an explanation by our leaders. I felt it was doubly unfair: to the bank who had been wilfully misled
          and not
          allowed to make their own assessment of the situation, and to our team, who were faced with something highly
          unusual yet were given no explanation or rationale, and were expected to perceive the situation as the norm. The
          values our
          company ascribed to were transparency and integrity, and I could not see how these squared with the action I just
          witnessed. So I publicly confronted the company rep, who was also my leader, and asked him respectfully for
          clarification
          of the situation and his rationale for such a decision. He told me and the rest of my team that what he did was
          indeed considered a practice for the company, not often used but considered normal, because the banks usually had
          much more
          power than clients and exerted their power by driving prices up for the clients. The company considered it a form
          of levelling the playing field and a way to ensure that the clients were given a fair price. We had a discussion
          about this
          situation and the company's values, and I never witnessed another such behavior in the company - though I changed
          position soon after and was no longer part of the conversations between the banks, clients, and our reps.</p>

      <section>
        <p>It was such a small situation, a small conversation conducted in an amiable and respectful way, yet it stayed
          with me for all those years. I probably ascribe more weight to it than any other of the participants, but I feel
          it affected
          the way I viewed the company and the way the company perceived me. If I were put in such a situation again, I
          would probably react in the same way, though.

      <p>I was raised in European culture where individual autonomy, responsibility and drive for achievement are coupled
        with care and empathy for others. European civilization was founded on the values of logic, rationalism, justice
        and inquisitiveness. I find the ancient Greek maxim, gnothi seauton, a constant source of motivation. In my social
        environment knowledge was always one of the fundamental values - ethical knowledge, defined as knowledge acquired
        in ethical ways and utilized for betterment/nonmaleficence for oneself and others.</p>

      <p>Gaining knowledge and giving knowledge are two sides of the same coin: knowledge shared is so much more impactful
        than knowledge hoarded. But these values would be powerless
        without an emotional component to ground them and guide them. My family taught me the value of love and
        compassion, of trust and support, of forgiveness and sacrifice. My family is the most important to me.</p>

    <p>Learning is my default mode because my curiosity and openness propel me to acquire constantly more knowledge and
      skills. I love learning new things.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>I am persistent and not easily deterred as I enjoy solving problems and always attempt to see them as
      opportunities to learn even further. I am driven and goal-oriented, self-determined and conscientious.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>I feel that perseverance and the feelings of enjoyment and accomplishment in one's work are key in dealing with
      difficult and frustrating elements of the learning process. Problems and difficulties are inevitable on a learning
      journey - so it's important to be aware of them and to be able to deal with them, and not get discouraged.</p>

      <p>I am rather shy and more introverted than extroverted. I tend to perceive group situations as requiring effort on
        my part and I tend to see them as somewhat challenging at first. I need time to get comfortable in such settings.
        This means I might initially not gain and/or contribute as much in such situations as I would normally do.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>I am not very forgiving to myself. I am self-driven and I tend to set myself very high expectations. I'm a bit of
        a perfectionist, and often find “good enough” not good enough for me. In short, I'm my own worst critic. I feel
        that long-term this might be a risk factor for burnout - or alternatively, workaholism ;)</p>

    <h1>Strategies for Productive Work</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="postDiv">
    <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="postDiv">
    <section>
      <p>Some of my early group projects during studies often exhibited an element of resistance or tension because
        everybody was so new to this type of work and we didn't know each other. The strategies that I found most useful
        at the time depended in large part on 1) the time constraints and 2) the type of work we were required to do. If we
        had a very limited time the best strategy was to divide work so that everyone could do their part with minimal
        overlap, and we would merge our respective pieces together at the end. Usually, by the end of the project the
        tension was gone anyway because along the way the problems have been worked out naturally or they didn't matter
        anymore. If time wasn't such a pressing issue and we needed to cooperate directly to achieve our goal I found that
        usually the most effective strategy for us was to organize a meeting, sit together, build trust, explain
        expectations, and try to figure out the problems. I feel like these strategies are still pretty effective, but these
        days I personally lean toward the second one, particularly because I consider trust a crucial component of cooperation.</p>
