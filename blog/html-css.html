      <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
      <h2>While these terms sound like something more related to fashion industry than programming, they are actually very helpful in visualising the look of the content on your 
        website. 
        They are all elements of a concept called the CSS Box Model.</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>The CSS Box Model is a visualisation of a set of layers surrounding every HTML element. Imagine an egg, an ogre, or
        an onion: yes, <strong>LAYERS!</strong>
      </p>
      <img src="Egg structure.png">
      <p>At the core of the CSS Box Model is the <strong>content</strong>. The text and/or images is always at the center of
        your box, just like the yolk sits at the center of the egg. Surrounding the content is a layer of <strong>padding</strong>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Padding</strong> is essentially a protective layer around your content that wraps it up on all sides so
        that the content doesn't touch the borders of its space - just like the white surrounding the yolk.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Border</strong> is the impregnable layer that separates your snuggly padded content from the outside world:
        think of the egg shell. You can make it visible or not, thick or thin - but it's always there.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Margin</strong> is the area that lies beyond the <strong>border</strong>. Imagine a lot of eggs! You can
        put them all together, risking smashing them all into scrambled eggs, or you can separate them from each other,
        putting each one in their own neat little containers.
      </p>
      <img src="Eggs in container.png">
      <p>But enough of the egg analogy. Here is a real-life example from this very blog:
      </p>
      <img src="CSS Box full.png">
      <p>As you can see, the border (indicated by the broken line on the image above) surrounds the content on every side.
        For margins (<span style="color: yellow">yellow</span>) and padding
        (<span style="color: purple">purple</span>), you can choose which side should or should not have them, and how
        thick: you can choose to have margins on all sides, as
        I did, or you can choose to have them on any side, or no side at all.</p>
      <p>CSS is nice enough to use the clockwork directions to indicate the sequence of directions: so the first slot is for
        "up," the second for "right,", the third for "bottom," and the fourth for "left." But if you write only one value, it
        will assume you want it on all sides.
