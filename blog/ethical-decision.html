      <p>The company I worked for had a process of setting up auctions between clients and banks to ensure fair pricing of products. One time one of two auction participants withdrew, and this decision should have prompted the end of the 
        auction process and the beginning of the negotiation process between the client and the one remaining bank. But my company representative decided to fake the auction for the benefit of the client and had one of my teammates pretend to 
        be on the call with the other bank. The call ended and the whole situation was treated like something normal and not requiring an explanation by our leaders. I felt it was doubly unfair: to the bank who had been wilfully misled and not
         allowed to make their own assessment of the situation, and to our team, who were faced with something highly unusual yet were given no explanation or rationale, and were expected to perceive the situation as the norm. The values our 
         company ascribed to were transparency and integrity, and I could not see how these squared with the action I just witnessed. So I publicly confronted the company rep, who was also my leader, and asked him respectfully for clarification 
         of the situation and his rationale for such a decision. He told me and the rest of my team that what he did was indeed considered a practice for the company, not often used but considered normal, because the banks usually had much more 
         power than clients and exerted their power by driving prices up for the clients. The company considered it a form of levelling the playing field and a way to ensure that the clients were given a fair price. We had a discussion about this 
         situation and the company's values, and I never witnessed another such behavior in the company - though I changed position soon after and was no longer part of the conversations between the banks, clients, and our reps.</p></section> 
        <p>It was such a small situation, a small conversation conducted in an amiable and respectful way, yet it stayed with me for all those years. I probably ascribe more weight to it than any other of the participants, but I feel it affected 
        the way I viewed the company and the way the company perceived me. If I were put in such a situation again, I would probably react in the same way, though.
