      <h1>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?

      <ul>
        <li>The power of habit. Absolutely mind-blowing. With this came the realization that I need to choose my habits
          carefully and paying attention to even small daily tasks is important.</li>
        <li>I like to have a bit of structure in my learning, particularly when I learn new things. I want to know what is
          important and what isn't, what should come first and what could wait in terms of accumulating knowledge and building
          on foundations. I haven't realized this before, and it was interesting - and challenging - to experience the
          discomfort of being totally new to a topic.</li>
        <li>I find it uncomfortable to write about myself - at least directly! I guess that's the reason I have a book blog,
          and not a personal blog ;).</li>

        <h1>What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?

      <div class="postDiv">
        <p>
          For me the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness is as big in learning and programming as it is in everything
          else in life, really - fundamental. Knowing oneself and wanting to know and understand others is in my opinion a key
          ingredient of a happy, conscious life.

        <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h1>
      </div>
      <div class="postDiv">
        <p>
          I found the sheer quantity and emphasis on core surprising, but very rewarding. Programming is stereotypically associated with
          technology, which is in turn perceived as something as far from emotional as possible. I like that here we're
          allowed - and encouraged - to embrace our fallible humanity ;).

        <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h1>
      </div>
      <div class="postDiv">
        <p>I was pretty stressed out by the first looping exercise: talking for two minutes straight about personal stuff to a
          person I never met before, and then listening to them! Afterwards, however, I found the experience quite fulfilling
          and enjoyable. It was a big relief to find out that other people out there are really in the same boat as I am, and
          it was great to just get in touch with a peer and talk and listen.

        <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
          development Bootcamp course?
        </h1>
      </div>
      <div class="postDiv">
        <p>Well, the stereotypes I mentioned earlier don't just pop up out of thin air ;). In our highly bureaucratic culture
          people were expected to assume work roles and bring nothing personal to their workplace - become highly efficient
          robots, in a sense. It's necessary to change this approach, on both ends: to change the organizational culture to
          become more inclusive and open, and capable of engendering trust, and to make people aware of their own behaviour,
          emotions, and needs, as well as the needs and emotions of others. We spend so much time at work, a third or more of
          every 24 hours, 5 times a week! We don't work alone - even when we work alone ;) Each of us is a node in a wide web
          of relationships and roles and responsibilities, and once we realize this and start paying more attention, our work
          can become more fulfilling and more enjoyable - not only for us, but also for others. Giving the soft skills a place
          in the limelight is a choice I can only applaud.

        <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time
          to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h1>
      </div>
      <div class="postDiv">
        <p>I don't think learning more about oneself can ever be a waste of time. To me, life is a journey. I can do many
          things in my life: programming, teaching, gardening, painting, what have you - but I'm always going to be me. I
          obviously think I should be better at programming than I am, and that I should learn more, but I always thought of
          DevAcademy as a place where you're given tools, not ready products. Programming languages and demands change all the
          time. More important to me is to learn the approaches and ways of thinking than actual pieces of code - those I can
          always find online or from other programmers, provided I learned how to look for them ;). And this is what I'm doing
          here right now, so I really can't feel that my time was wasted - on the contrary, I feel it was well spent.
