      <h1>Blocked on a Problem</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>This week we had our JS kata exercises. I felt a bit overwhelmed with the function which was supposed to populate
        an object, and create and populate another object within. I felt as if the answer was just beyond the reach, because
        I was pretty sure I knew all the necessary elements already and just needed to build a function out of them. I was
        stumped! Eventually, I decided to go back to the basics, and went through the earlier exercises. I found that
        visualizing what the final result should look like helped me realize what path I needed to take to get there. Once I
        got there, it was just a matter of trial-and-error with regards to the syntax. Console.log became one of my
        favourite problem-solving aids, as this way I can check exactly what I think I'm doing vs. what I'm actually doing.
        Working through this exercise - and arriving at the solution all on my own - made me feel that I'm making real
        progress. I learned that sometimes the best solution is to step away and take a breather, and approach the problem
        with a fresh eye.

      <p>Another of JS kata exercises pertained to finding and removing specific elements within a string and an array by
        utilizing built-in methods. I was able to solve this problem quickly and efficiently through research and
        brainstorming. Once again, I first needed to visualize the end result to be able to choose the correct approach.
        Once I knew what I needed to get there, it was a matter of console-logging out the consecutive steps. I'm quite
        proud of my final function, as it's written in an efficient way: short and self-explanatory, and not much different
        from the solution proposed by the facilitators.</p>

      <h1>Problem-solving Techniques</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>I'm stubborn and I want to do many things myself in order to better understand them. Which means I'm more partial
        to some methods than others. My current favourites are trying something, reading error messages, console.logging and
        googling, and trying to figure out what went well and what went wrong afterwards so that I can do better next time.
        I believe that teaching others is one of the best methods to learn, but as I'm not confident enough yet in most of
        this stuff, I prefer to explain my coding problems and solutions to my imaginary friends. Just like rubber ducky,
        they're never bored ;)</p>
    
      <p>I definitely can improve my pseudocode skills, my explanations are either winding and roundabout or basically
        repeating my code, but I'll get there! And asking peers and coaches for help is for me a bit of a last resort
        option, after all others are exhausted, so I use it sparingly, even too little perhaps. I always feel like everyone
        has better things to do than delving into my bumbling coding problems, so there seems to be a lot of room for
        improvement in my approach ;).
      </p>
      <p>If I were to rate my mastery of various problem-solving techniques, I'd probably use my typical book-rating scale: 1
        to 5, where 1 is dismal and 5 is great. Here we go!</p>
