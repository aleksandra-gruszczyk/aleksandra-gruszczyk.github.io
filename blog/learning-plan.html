      <h2>Career Pathway</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>Right now, I'm more of a journey than destination kind of person. I love learning and solving problems, and so
        programming is very appealing to me. But I also feel I'm at the beginning of that particular journey. Will there be
        some part of programming that will capture my attention and passion more than other things? Possibly. I have some
        projects in mind, but they too are very diverse - from a TBR app to big data tools :D So I guess my answer here is
        “let's learn and see.”

      <h2>Biggest Strengths and Limitations in Bootcamp</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>My goodness, I just checked my list of strengths and limitations from Foundations and I can sign this list again,
        with both hands. Sometimes I just want to sink my teeth into a piece of code and just shred it to pieces, I'm that
        frustrated with it - but I won't ask for help until all other possibilities are exhausted ;). I definitely need to
        work on reaching out for help earlier.

      <h2>Biggest Non-technical Challenge at Bootcamp</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>Time-management. I'm a family person, and my family is always my priority. Shifting this, even for 9 weeks, will be
        a challenge. I have been preparing myself for this shift, and my family has too, but reality has a way of
        reasserting itself even against best-laid plans, and I need to be aware of this possibility.

      <h2>Human Skills Development</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>Public speaking; pair programming (it's technical but at the same time it's not, it's all about ego and behavioural
        patterns and trust and cooperation ;)); building good working habits; and more self-care.

    <div class="postDiv">
      <h2>Expectations regarding Bootcamp Team</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>Mentoring, by which I mean a mature student-teacher relationship where the knowledge is a result of
        cooperation and growth.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <h2>Expectations regarding myself</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>Seeking help<br><br>
        Seeking help is what I will need to work on during Bootcamp. I will set a timeframe for solving stuff on my own and
        if I go over that time I will reach out to others. The timeframe will be project-related and so changeable, but once
        I set it I will stick to it.
        <br><br>
        Managing workload<br><br>
        My resolution for Bootcamp is to not work 24/7. Might be counterintuitive, I know, but knowing myself I am going to
        have a tendency to just dive into work and do it all the time, and this is not something I will be able to sustain
        for 9 weeks. My plan is to include rest time in my schedule, and be very mindful of it, to avoid burnout. The second
        item on my agenda is being open and upfront about any time constraints, other commitments and work-related
        bottlenecks with my peers, facilitators and community representatives.

      <h2>Career Pathway</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
        <p>My long-term career pathway seems forked at the moment; I'm not yet certain which path I ultimately want to
          choose. My two goals right now are 1) the focus on programming/developing, which I'm currently finding a lot of
          fun and a lot of challenge, and 2) the focus on human skills within the programming/developing sphere, where I can
          utilize my knowledge in the areas of organizational culture/ways of working. I like teaching/coaching and I hope I
          will be able to combine my passion with the newfound knowledge from DevAcademy.

      <h2>Learning Strengths</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
        <p>My learning strengths stem mostly from my passion for learning:</p>
        <ul><li>curiosity</li>
          <li>conscientiousness</li>
          <li>perseverance</li>
          <li>focus on problem-solving</li>
          <li>diligence</li>
          <li>ability to assimilate new knowledge quickly</li>
          <li>accountability</li>

      <h2>Learning Limitations</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>My learning limitations are probably many but let's focus on just few:</p>
        <ul><li>perfectionism</li>
          <li>stubbornness</li>
          <li>introversion</li>
          <li>tendency to burn the candle on both ends</li>
          <li>impatience with myself</li>

      <h2>Non-technical skills to develop at DevAcademy</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>I'd like to focus on two main areas: team-work and my wellbeing</p>
       <ul><li>becoming more comfortable in group situations</li>
          <li>better understanding of the expectations of a modern workplace</li>
          <li>effective stress management</li>
          <li>creating effective mental habits around work and mindfulness practices</li>

      <h2>Managing workload</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">

        <p>This course is hefty, indeed. 15 weeks of hard work, 40 to 70 hours a week. My plan is to pace myself to avoid
          burnout, and to keep to the regular working hours as much as possible. Free time is important for rest and
          recuperation, and some rewarding comforts become a necessity in such a tightly managed schedule. That said, I
          intend to learn as much from this course as I can. A vital part of this is interacting with others: getting to
          know other students, sharing knowledge and experiences, helping them and learning from them. We're all in this
          together.
        </p> 
        <p>I have no illusions that this course will take a lot from me; there will be moments of doubt and
          exhaustion, and on such a journey it's inevitable to have both ups and downs. I feel that the key here is honesty
          - with myself and with others. I'm very fortunate to have the enormous support of my family.

      <h2>Seeking help in a timely way</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">

        <p>My plan is simple, really: first, try to find a solution on my own; if that doesn't work, I will ask for my
          cohort's help; then, the facilitators' help. Asking for help - and giving help - are for me an important part of
          the learning journey.</p>

      <h2>Expectations regarding the Facilitation team</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">

        <p>Help and guidance when needed, and support throughout. I find the fact that the facilitators went through the
          same experiences as us comforting - they've been in the same boat, and they did emerge unscathed ;).</p>
