      <h1>Long Term goals</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
        <p>My long-term career pathway seems forked at the moment; I'm not yet certain which path I ultimately want to
          choose. My two goals right now are 1) the focus on programming/developing, which I'm currently finding a lot of
          fun and a lot of challenge, and 2) the focus on human skills within the programming/developing sphere, where I can
          utilize my knowledge in the areas of organizational culture/ways of working. I like teaching/coaching and I hope I
          will be able to combine my passion with the newfound knowledge from DevAcademy.

      <h1>Learning Strengths</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
        <p>My learning strengths stem mostly from my passion for learning:</p>
        <ul><li>curiosity</li>
          <li>conscientiousness</li>
          <li>perseverance</li>
          <li>focus on problem-solving</li>
          <li>diligence</li>
          <li>ability to assimilate new knowledge quickly</li>
          <li>accountability</li>  
        </ul>

      <h1>Learning Limitations</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>My learning limitations are probably many but let's focus on just few:</p>
        <ul><li>perfectionism</li>
          <li>stubbornness</li>
          <li>introversion</li>
          <li>tendency to burn the candle on both ends</li>
          <li>impatience with myself</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Non-technical skills to develop at DevAcademy</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>I'd like to focus on two main areas: team-work and my wellbeing</p>
       <ul><li>becoming more comfortable in group situations</li>
          <li>better understanding of the expectations of a modern workplace</li>
          <li>effective stress management</li>
          <li>creating effective mental habits around work and mindfulness practices</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Managing workload</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">

        <p>This course is hefty, indeed. 15 weeks of hard work, 40 to 70 hours a week. My plan is to pace myself to avoid
          burnout, and to keep to the regular working hours as much as possible. Free time is important for rest and
          recuperation, and some rewarding comforts become a necessity in such a tightly managed schedule. That said, I
          intend to learn as much from this course as I can. A vital part of this is interacting with others: getting to
          know other students, sharing knowledge and experiences, helping them and learning from them. We're all in this
          together.</p> 
        <p>I have no illusions that this course will take a lot from me; there will be moments of doubt and
          exhaustion, and on such a journey it's inevitable to have both ups and downs. I feel that the key here is honesty
          - with myself and with others. I'm very fortunate to have the enormous support of my family.</p>

      <h1>Seeking help in a timely way</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">

        <p>My plan is simple, really: first, try to find a solution on my own; if that doesn't work, I will ask for my
          cohort's help; then, the facilitators' help. Asking for help - and giving help - are for me an important part of
          the learning journey.</p>

    <div class="postDiv">
      <h1>Expectations regarding the Facilitation team</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">

        <p>Help and guidance when needed, and support throughout. I find the fact that the facilitators went through the
          same experiences as us comforting - they've been in the same boat, and they did emerge unscathed ;).</p>
