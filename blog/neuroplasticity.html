      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="postDiv">
      <p>Neuroplasticity is a term referring to the brain's ability to grow and change neural paths and networks.
        Previously, it was believed that the brain is like a fruit: it grows and ripens, achieving its peak at maturity, and
        later it slowly rots away, becoming less and less capable. Nowadays, research shows that this image is incorrect:
        brains grow mostly when we are young, true, and they do achieve some form of maturity and later go into slow decay,
        but they are far more flexible and malleable than we used to give them credit for. The brain has the ability to
        adapt to experience and can be developed and trained, more like a muscle than a fruit. The more we learn, the more
        capable of learning our brain becomes.</p>
      <p>This wonderful ability of the brain is particularly important in the perspective of the concept of lifelong learning. Neuroplasticity allows us to
        learn new things regardless of age; it also allows us to slow down or even reverse the decay of our neural pathways,
        keeping us mentally fit and agile. In short, thanks to our brain's plasticity, as long as we have curiosity and
        willingness to learn, we can!</p>

        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="postDiv">
        <p>
          Growth Mindset is a concept popularized by a psychology researcher Carol Dweck. It is juxtaposed with the concept of
          Fixed
          Mindset and focused on the interpretative process through which we approach ourselves and the world around us.
          Growth mindset is a set of beliefs centred around learning as a most effective way of coping with challenges. Fixed
          mindset, on the other hand, puts emphasis on the immutability of inherited traits, be they intelligence or talent,
          or empathy. Growth and fixed mindsets are two ends of a continuum, with plenty of stages between. Moreover, we don't
          exhibit one mindset throughout everything we approach - rather, we have many attitudes toward different areas of our
          experience. This means that we can have a more growth-oriented attitude toward certain things, and a more fixed
          approach toward others. Growth-oriented attitude allows us to embrace challenges more eagerly as an opportunity to
          learn and develop our skills. It gives us mental fortitude to deal with failures and perceive them not as reflection
          of our worth but rather of our preparedness. The key concept of the growth mindset is “not yet;” it's an assumption
          that when we fail, it's because we haven't yet learned enough, and not because we're not good enough to succeed.
          This allows us to be willing to improve and try again.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the concepts of growth and fixed mindsets can be very beneficial in understanding our approach to various
          areas of our lives, it's worth remembering that they are a simplification of many diverse psychological traits and
          preferences. We are not infinitely malleable; there are some personal traits that are fixed, or even inherited, and
          while we can get better at everything with enough work, effort, and mental fortitude, we should also have realistic
          expectations of what we can achieve. In the end, the concept of growth mindset can be boiled down to the assertion
          that while we start the game of life with a collection of set qualities, we can work on improving them. It's a
          Pascalian wager worth taking - because the more you learn, the better you become at learning :).
